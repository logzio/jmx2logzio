// This file was taken from https://github.com/prometheus/prometheus/blob/master/prompb/remote.proto
// and modified to include only the relevant definitions for Remote Write (removing Read)
// Also removed usage of nullable annotation of GoGo - Go lang library for generating code from protobuf
// which is not relevant for us (also since those files are not in the source, and a few hours
// weren't enough to try to get `make proto` to actually work on the prometheus repo)
